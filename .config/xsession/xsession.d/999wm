# This file needs to be last and needs to exec() the
# process which will keep the session open. This is usually
# some kind of session manager (like xsm) or the window manager
# like i3. 
#
# When the following process terminates the entire session will be
# closed. By exec()ing the window manager here we allow a 
# desktop environment specific hotkey to end the session.

exec i3
